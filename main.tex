Here we propose the use of deep learning-based methods to estimate the AIF, 1) directly from the entire dynamic PET images (NN-AEIF), or 2) from the image-derived input function (IDIF) (NN-IDIF). We also test the same methods to metabolite-correct the un-corrected plasma curve (NN-AIF) (WHY DO WE NEED THIS???). All the NN-based methods output a measure for prediction uncertainty. The three methods (together with IDIF) were compared to the metabolite-corrected AIF in terms of VT, while the uncertainty of each NN-based method was assessed in terms of CV. Overall, both NN-AEIF and NN-AIF were able to accurately predict VTs, outperforming the other methods, with NN-AEIF showing the lowest CV.

    The invasiveness and technical demands of arterial sampling and metabolite correction, which are prerequisites for the measurement of $\mathrm{V_T}$s for many radioligands, limit the application of full quantification in both research and clinical PET studies. 
    Machine learning approaches have been explored to predict $\mathrm{V_T}$s from PET images, but their integration in clinical routine is limited by the lack of transparent and reproducible outcomes. Here we propose a Bayesian Neural Network to estimate the AIF (which can then be used for kinetic modelling) while also outputting its prediction uncertainty, 1) directly from the entire dynamic PET images (NN-AEIF), 2) from the image-derived input function (IDIF) (NN-IDIF) and, as sensitivity measure, 3) from the un-corrected plasma curve (NN-AIF). All methods were compared to the metabolite-corrected AIF in terms of $\mathrm{V_T}$, and the prediction uncertainty was assessed in terms of normalised coefficient of variance (nCV). Overall, both NN-AEIF and NN-AIF were able to accurately predict $\mathrm{V_T}$s, outperforming the other methods, with NN-AEIF showing the lowest nCV.

    % The Volume of distribution ($ \mathrm{V_T}$) estimated with an arterial input function (AIF) is the gold standard for quantitation of many PET radiotracers, often requiring radiometabolite-correction. However, arterial sampling is a laborious and invasive procedure. Machine learning approaches have been explored to directly predict $ \mathrm{V_T}$s from PET images, but they are not sufficiently transparent to trust in clinical practice.  Here we propose to estimate the input function from dynamic PET images (NN-AEIF), as well as to metabolite-correct the IDIF (NN-IDIF) and the un-corrected  plasma curve (NN-AIF). Moreover, all the NN-based methods output a measure for prediction uncertainty that can be used in subsequent quality-control stages. The three methods (together with IDIF) were compared to the metabolite-corrected AIF in terms of V{$_\mathrm{T}$}, while the uncertainty of each NN-based method was assessed in terms of normalised (nCV). Overall, both NN-AEIF and NN-AIF were able to accurately predict V{$_\mathrm{T}$}s, outperforming the other methods, with NN-AEIF showing the lowest nCV.
